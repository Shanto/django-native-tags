.. moduleauthor:: Justin Quick <justquick@gmail.com>

Django Native Tags is a way of making the creation of most template tags stupidly simple.
Tags are "native" because there is a much closer relationship between the tag in the template and a Python function behind the scenes
The app abstracts most of the work needed to parse out the templatetag syntax into a useable form for a Python function.
For example:

Define a comparison function in your templatetags::

   def slug_in(test_slug, *slugs):
      return test_slug in slugs
   slug_in.comparison = True
   
Use the function in your template::

   {% ifslug_in blog.slug 'business' 'politics' 'national news' %}
      You are reading a boring blog
   {% endifslug_in %}

The real power of the module comes in the contrib package which has 66 included tags right out of the box and ready to use.
See the contrib page for more info.
